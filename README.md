# code-refactor
The marketing agency, Horiseon, wanted their website to follow accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines.

The first thing I did to improve SEO was to give a title to their website.I added a missing id to search engine optimization to fix non-functionality of clicking the top menu. Next I moved on to giving semantic structure to the HTML element which will improve it's SEO. I ammended the CSS style sheet to reflect the changes I made to the html. Accessible alt attributes were added to the important images on the page to improve accessibility.
